            <h2>Dry Chilies: Exports and Production</h2>

            <p> I have always had a fascination with chilies. They're particulary unique as vegetables go, and their potency is tangible, measurable, and, now, tunable 
                (yes we can breed them to contain insane scoville levels).
                Dried chilies are particular pungent and can be added to a variety of different foods, including soups, to 'up' their flavor and add a kick. 
                They are also really easy to transport as they do not spoil and are loved by people across the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                    Looking at the export volumes of dried chilies from different countries around the world, we can immediately see that the market is dominated by both China and India.
                While these countries are known for their spicy foods, the sheer volume of exports surprised me. Together, they make up over 80% of total dried chili exports around the globe.
                Other unsurprising appearances are Mexico, Myanmar, and Tunisia (known for its Harissa).

            <p> So where are dried chilies amongst other spices being traded around the world? Are they popular? Are they a recent fad?
                <br>
                Not at all! Here we can see how chilies have consistently been among the most exported spices since the early 90s. 
                Starting in 1993, about 200,000 metric tons of dried chilies were exported each year. Today, that number has reached over 1 million metric tons per year. That's a lot of chilies!
            </p>
            <p>
            One can also see how ginger has closely followed the same trends as our dried chilies. This is not necessarily a coincidence. 
            Indeed, since the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, we have seen a significant drop in tariffs between nations on spices. This is truly the era of globalization.
            Moreover, we can see exacly how the ascension of India and soon later China correlates with the rise of all spice exports, but especially ginger and dried chilies.
